The video game is a reinterpretation of the well-know ‘space invaders’. In this article, you will see (and hopefully understand) the steps & design process I’ve followed to complete the video game. 

The argument of ‘You’re rocking’  is a single player video game where you’re the responsable person to save the astronauts who got lost in a space expeditions by NASA. The astronauts one have two O2 bottle with not much oxigen in it. The aliens, you enemies, are chasing you around the space. They don’t want you to save the astronauts. Aliens want to abduct them and bring them to their own planet. However, you can save them by taking them in your rockets and bringing them to the Earth. 


I’ve decided to you the aesthetic of 8bits for the visual concept of this video game. To create all the elements and their variations for the animations, I’ve used one of my favourite tools nowadays: OPEN AI - DALLE
